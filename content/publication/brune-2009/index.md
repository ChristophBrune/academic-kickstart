abstract: "In this paper, we propose a new optimization approach for the simultaneous computation of optical flow and edge detection therein. Instead of using an Ambrosioâ€“Tortorelli type energy functional, we reformulate the optical flow problem as a multidimensional control problem. The optimal control problem is solved by discretization methods and large-scale optimization techniques. The edge detector can be immediately built from the control variables. We provide three series of numerical examples. The first shows that the mere presence of a gradient restriction has a regularizing effect, while the second demonstrates how to balance the regularizing effects of a term within the objective and the control restriction. The third series of numerical results is concerned with the direct evaluation of a TV-regularization term by introduction of control variables with sign restrictions."
