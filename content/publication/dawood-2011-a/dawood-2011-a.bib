 abstract = {Motion artifacts due to cardiac motion are well known. These artifacts may lead to quantification errors in PET imaging. Using cardiac gating reduces the motion artifacts but increases the noise level due to lesser amount of information per gate. Therefore to use a motion correction scheme to utilize all PET information whereas avoiding the motion artifacts is advisable. In this study a new method of cardiac motion correction on 3D-PET data is presented which is based on mass conserving optical flow.},
