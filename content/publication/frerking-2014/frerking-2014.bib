 abstract = {The aim of this paper is to track transmigrating leukocytes via TGV flow estimation. Recent results have shown the advantages of the nonlinear and higher order terms of TGV regularizers, especially in static models for denoising and medical reconstruction. We present TGV-based models for flow esti- mation with the goal to get an exact recovery of simple intracellular and extracellular flows, as well as its implication on realistic tracking situations for transmigration through barriers. To study and quantify di ff erent pathways of transmigrating leukocytes, we use large scale 4D fluorescence live microscopy data in vivo.},
