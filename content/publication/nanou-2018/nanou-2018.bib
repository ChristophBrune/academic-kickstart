 abstract = {Purpose: The presence of Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) patients is associated with poor prognosis. In this study, we evaluated the association of clinical outcome in 129 CRPC patients with CTCs, tumor-derived Extracellular Vesicles (tdEVs) and plasma levels of total (CK18) and caspase-cleaved cytokeratin 18 (ccCK18). Experimental Design: CTCs and tdEVs were isolated with the CellSearch system and automatically enumerated. Cut-off values dichotomizing patients into favorable and unfavorable groups of overall survival were set on a retrospective data set of 84 patients and validated on a prospective data set of 45 patients. Plasma levels of CK18 and ccCK18 were assessed by ELISAs. Results: CTCs, tdEVs and both cytokeratin plasma levels were significantly increased in CRPC patients compared to healthy donors (HDs). All biomarkers except for ccCK18 were prognostic showing a decreased median overall survival for the unfavorable groups of 9.2 vs 21.1, 8.1 vs 23.0 and 10.0 vs 21.5 months respectively. In multivariable Cox regression analysis, tdEVs remained significant. Conclusions: Automated CTC and tdEV enumeration allows fast and reliable scoring eliminating inter- and intra- operator variability. tdEVs provide similar prognostic information to CTC counts.},
